divSwappingBanner
=================

JQuery plugin where you can show a certain div block based on an image that you select.

Compatibilities
=================
Requires JQuery version 1.8.0 or higher. Works with 2.0.0 and above also.

Compatible with Firfox, Chrome and Internet Explorer 8 and above. Untested on other browsers.

Note that JQuery 2.0.0 required Internet Explorer 9 and above.
It does function with Internet Explorer 6 and 7 but the layout is not as it is intended to look. The same is true with lesser versions
of JQuery.

A minified version of JQuery 1.10.0 is included in the package and is used in the demo.
